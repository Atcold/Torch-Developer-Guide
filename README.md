# Torch Developer Guide

This repository tries to provide some advanced tricks with [Torch7](http://torch.ch/) explained easily

## *FFI* series

[*LuaJIT*](http://luajit.org/) [*FFI library*](http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html) provides an incredible easy way to call external *C* functions and use *C* data structures from pure Lua code.
The *FFI series* will provide several working examples of playing with *C* from within *Torch*, taking for granted no prior knowledge of building `.so` libraries, using `Makefile` or tackling *Tensors* pointers.
